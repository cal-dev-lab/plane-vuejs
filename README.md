# plane-vuejs

## air11-UK
This is a site for an airplane enthusiast in the UK. This will host an image gallery, contact forms and hero sections. 
I have used Vue 3 and TailwindCSS. Think this will make for a fast site as I can purge the Tailwind CSS files on build for production.

## Hosting
I have used Netlify for this as it is super quick for deployment and can host multiple sites in one place. This is also a good platform to use as I am able to add members to the Netlify team and can give permissions, good for collaborative projects.

## Install Tailwind with VueJS
After a bit of researching, I have found a great article for installing Tailwind with VueJS:
